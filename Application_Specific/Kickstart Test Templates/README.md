# Kickstart Test Templates
This folder contains several tests that could be run on Keithley's Kickstart software using SMUs with MOSFETs, Diodes, and Resistors.

* **[NFET Ig-Vg Test](./NFET_ig-vg)**  
Test to see the gate current leakage occurring in a MOSFET device.

* **[NFET Vds-Id Test](./NFET_vds-id)**  
Test to see the relationship between Current and Voltage at the Drain of a MOSFET device.

* **[NFET Vgs-Id](./NFET_vgs-id)**  
Test to see the Threshold Voltage and Max Gain of a MOSFET device.

* **[Resistor Sweep](./resistor_sweep)**  
Test to see the relationship between Current and Voltage in a resistor when Voltage is sourced.

* **[Diode - Forward Bias - 1 Channel](./VFD_1channel)**  
Test to see the Forward Bias Voltage of a Diode using only 1 channel of a multichannel SMU (Ex: 2612B) or using 1 single-channel SMU (Ex: 2450).

* **[Diode - Forward Bias - 2 Channel](./VFD_2channel)**  
Test to see the Forward Bias Voltage of a Diode using both channels of a multichannel SMU (Ex: 2612B) or using 2 single-channel SMUs (Ex: 2450).

* **[Diode - Reverse Bias - 1 Channel](./VRD_1channel)**  
Test to see the Reverse Bias Voltage of a Diode using only 1 channel of a multichannel SMU (Ex: 2612B) or using 1 single-channel SMU (Ex: 2450).

* **[Diode - Reverse Bias - 2 Channel](./VRD_2channel)**  
Test to see the Reverse Bias Voltage of a Diode using both channels of a multichannel SMU (Ex: 2612B) or using 2 single-channel SMUs (Ex: 2450).
