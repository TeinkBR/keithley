Script code that allows the Series 2400 Interactive SourceMeters to operate as a general battery simulator. The script comes preconfigured <br>
with a set of battery models to select from: 18650, CR2032, etc. More models may be added to the script if the operator chooses (this will require<br>
an update to the code) or they can load a model from a USB thumb drive inserted into the front of the target SourceMeter. Note that new batter<br>
models can be created using the model generation script located in the [Model Generation Script folder](../Model_Generation_Script).
